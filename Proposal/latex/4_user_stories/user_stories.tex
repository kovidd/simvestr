\section{User Stories and Sprints}
    \label{sec:user_stories}

\subsection{Landing Page and Authentication/Registration}
    \label{subsec:landing_page}
    
The system workflow begins with a simple landing page whereby existing users are prompted to log-in and first-time users are prompted to sign-up with the system through entering a valid email address as well as choosing the preferred starting capital to trade with. The user stories in this epic are:\\

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-3:} As an unregistered user visiting the application’s landing page, I want to register using my email address and a password so that the system can remember me and my data.
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-4:} As an unregistered user, I want to see an error message if something goes wrong when I attempt to register for an account so that I can recover from the error.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{\textbf{Definition of Done:} This story is considered done when a visually distinguishable message is shown to the unregistered user, together with explanation what is incorrect (e.g. email missing an “@” symbol).} 
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-5:}  As an unregistered user, I want to receive a confirmation email once my registration is successful so that I can confirm that I successfully registered and able to log in with my chosen credentials.

\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-10:} As a user (registered and unregistered), I want to learn about the application and its features so that I get familiar with what features are available.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{\textbf{Definition of Done:} This story is considered done when information about the application and its features are available to the user on the landing page.} 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Search and Watchlist}
    \label{subsec:search_watchlist}

The watchlist is whereby the users can add or remove their preferred shares or those shares that are yet to prove to be profitable based on the trading strategy adopted. The watchlist offers sufficient information for the user to be able to act swiftly to prevent missing a valuable opportunity. The watchlist features buy and sell buttons for each stock to enhance the functionality of the overall system. To add new stocks to the watchlist, the user searches for the stock using the stock's symbol or company name from the search bar. The user stories in this epic are:\\

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-13:} As a user, I want to search for stocks by the stock’s symbol or company name so that I can see a list of stocks matching my search. 
\begin{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{\textbf{Definition of Done:} This story is considered done when stocks can be removed from the user’s watchlist page along with all the detailed information about them.} 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Market Orders}
    \label{subsec:market_orders}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Portfolio Dashboard}
    \label{subsec:portfolio_dashboard}

The portfolio dashboard comprises the most intriguing yet critical page for the user. The portfolio dashboard allows the user to observe each holding separately in terms of the stock name, number of shares held, the average price of entry for the aggregated positions, the current share price, and the nominal  gain. Additionally, the total gain is depicted within a graph that shows the day closing portfolio value to observe the portfolio growth over time. Finally, from the portfolio dashboard, the user has the convenience of buying more positions and closing open positions (or part of open positions) to increase the platform versatility. The user stories in this epic are:\\

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-31:} As a user, I want to view aggregate statistics about my portfolio including the current portfolio value, the day return from the portfolio as well as the total return so that I can have an overview of my portfolio.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{\textbf{Definition of Done:} This story is considered done when a sell button is displayed next to each constituent of the portfolio allowing the user to place a market order to sell from the stock.} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Account Settings}
    \label{subsec:account_settings}

On the account settings side, the user can change the password or details and log-out from the system. The user stories in this epic are:\\

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-37:} As a user, I can change my first name, last name and password because my preferences might have changed since creating the account.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{\textbf{Definition of Done:} This story is considered done when the user can log out from the application and all authentication information is removed.} 
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Additional (Novel) Features}
    \label{subsec:additional_features}
There are several other features that the user may find useful in an investment simulator which provide novel functionality compared to existing systems. Here we provide several ideas for developing the system further which we aim to implement as part of this project. Although some of the systems described in section \ref{subsec:existing_systems} do include the features (described below) individually, none of them have all of these features concurrently. This, in combination with a unique user experience, results in a unique and novel system. 

The user stories describing these features are:

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-69:} As a user, I can invest in cryptocurrencies so that I can diversify my portfolio.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{\textbf{Definition of Done:} This story is considered done when the user can buy and sell cryptocurrencies in a manner similar to regular stocks.} 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{\textbf{Definition of Done:} This story is considered done when the user can export the portfolio constituents with all the related details in CSV format.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{User Story CWPGD-71:} As a user, I can view the leaders board so that I can assess how I rank with respect to other users of the investment simulator.
\begin{itemize}

\end{table}

\subsection{Sprints Schedule and First Sprint}
    \label{subsec:sprint_schedule}

The below details the sprints schedule we have agreed upon for the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sprint 1:} Sunday, September 24, 2020 - Saturday, October 10, 2020
    \item \textbf{Sprint 2:} Sunday, October 11, 2020 - Saturday, October 24, 2020 
    \item \textbf{Sprint 3:} Sunday, October 25, 2020 - Saturday, November 7, 2020 
    \item \textbf{Sprint 4:} Sunday, November 8, 2020 - Saturday, November 16, 2020
\end{itemize}


On the first day of each sprint (Sunday), the group will perform the sprint planning whereby we will review the backlog and categorize user stories by priority, determine the stories to be completed during the sprint, and create the sprint in Jira and assign sub-tasks to group members.

On the last day of each sprint (Saturday), the group will perform a sprint review and retrospective where by we will reflect on the sprint that has been completed and discuss what went well and what did not as well as agree on any changes or improvements that are to be implemented in the following sprint.


\textit{As the images of the backlog, sprint schedule and first print are quite large (meaning the text is small when scaled to an A4 page), additional full sized copies have been included in the appendix for easy reference.}

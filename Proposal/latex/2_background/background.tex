\subsection{Problem Statement}
    \label{subsec:problem_statement}
    
Although today several systems exist that tackle the virtualization of a trading ecosystem, many fall short of the intended goal which is to create a real experience for the users to better understand the risks involved in trading the stock market and in order to asses their skill sets. The reason behind falling short, is that these systems are often linked to actual real money trading brokers who wish to capitalize on the virtual ecosystem offering. This is done through making the virtual account available for only a limited amount of time (e.g. 1 week or 1 month) and then the account is automatically closed down whereby the systems often try to lure the user into depositing real money and starting real trading. A short duration of time is not sufficient to tackle a full experience within the stock market given its long-term nature as opposed to other trading instruments such as Forex trading and options trading. Our systems aims to fill the gap through offering an open-ended virtual accounts with no termination date in order to ensure that our users can benefit from an effective marketplace to learn, observe, and trade virtual stocks rather than learning through blowing up their own accounts and wasting their real money.

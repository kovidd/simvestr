\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}

People often seek investment vehicles as a method to expand their savings and diversify their savings portfolio. Several investment vehicles are available for investors to achieve the goal of diversification and value creation such as bonds, stocks, options, and derivatives, but each of these vehicles demands extensive skill sets to master the intricacies present beyond the boundaries of each marketplace. Given the focus on stock market within the spectrum of this project, our aim is to advance the skill sets of our users to ensure that stock trading risks are properly acknowledged. 

Traditionally, stock trading and potentially investing in public companies was considered an exclusivity to high-value portfolios which used to have a dedicated broker and whereby communication took place over the phone to place orders of buying and selling stocks. With the advancement of technology, exchange mediums have become readily available from the convenience of a person's computer, tablet, or even smartphone. Technology advancement has opened the doors for many new and beginner traders and investors to enter the world of stock investing whereby they are often lured in by marketing campaigns and ‘get rich’ false ads. However, it must be noted that the stock market is considered an endless maze for new traders who are often lost in the labyrinth of technical terms and finance lingo. Additionally, high frequency trading has put the retail trader at a disadvantage against huge machines and servers which trade on microsecond-based analysis based on market changes, data releases, and news. This fact creates yet another barrier for the retail traders who are often either hesitant that they miss the chance of learning about the stock market or, on the other end of the spectrum, too confident that they fall under the impression that the stock market is a money making machine, which frequently ends badly for the trader.

To combat the before-mentioned hurdles that retail traders are often faced with, our aim is to create a virtual market ecosystem allowing traders and investors access to  a unique experience that mimics the real stock exchange medium but rather with virtual money or 'credits'. The user is given a set amount of virtual money to simul-buy or simul-sell preferred shares in order to test the investment strategy rather than risking the user’s own capital at first. The virtual market allows the users to evaluate the decisions taken in the short-term and long-term through measuring portfolio yield in terms of absolute return and capital relative return. The virtual process allows the traders to avoid falling into the marketing gimmicks and false advertisements by taking the trading system into a trial period to better make informed decision about whether more knowledge and training is require before actually investing hard-earned money into the stock market.

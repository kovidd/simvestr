\section{Story Boards}
    \label{sec:story_boards}

This section presents the story boards to outline the basic functionalities of the investment simulator. Storyboarding helps develop a sense of how the system will look, and how users can interact with it before it is formally designed and developed. 

The design of the wireframes and the story boards, are driven by two main usability principles: aesthetics/minimalist design and efficiency. We intend to develop a system that enables the investor to search for investment opportunities in an accessible and clutter-free environment. Additionally, the design incorporates efficiency in every aspect where buy investors can access their portfolio, execute transactions, and watch stocks with a few clicks. It should be noted that these storyboards are not to be taken for complete, concrete designs, as they are only used here to illustrate the users flow and interaction with the system.
